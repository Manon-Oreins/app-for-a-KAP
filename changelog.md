# Kapotopia - Changelog

## Alpha-0.3 - code: 10 - 2019/11/01
- General
  - Gradle version has been downgraded due to incompatibility problems with some computers of the devs. We now use v3.3.2 instead of v3.4.2. Thus gradle scripts also have been rewritten to met old standards.
  - Added a few helper classes for devs, like a LabelBuilder or a ImageHelper
  - New packages has been created to group together classes with the same functionnality
- Game1
  General Refractor of the code
  - Aesthetic
    - New background and new STI's and fake STI's
    - New background for the introduction of the game, without any text yet
    - Font has been changed to the COMMS font and changed from black to white, for clarity
    - A sound is now played when the player touch a STI
    - A small "missed" text appears when a true STI is missed by the player
    - Enemi labels has been (somewhat) aligned with the picture
  - Gameplay
    - Added a pause Icon to manually pause the game
    - Difficulty
      - More STI's and fake STI's have been added. The number of each stay equivalent so the difficulty stay balanced.
      - Added a difficulty choosing screen. The player can now choose which difficulty he want to play the game. The screen allowing the player to choose the difficulty has been standardized and therefore can be reused in other parts of the game
      - Overall difficulty has been increased
    - New label that shows how much STI's has been catched
    - Improved the learning part (#22) by adding a short description of the STI's not catched (shown on the bilan screen)
  - Bug fixing
    - Fixed a bug in #20 referenced issue, causing the game to not scale to certain screen configurations
    - Fixed the failed sound not playing (that plays when the player miss a STI) when the screen is shown for the first time. It was caused by the sound not properly loaded into memory to instantly play it when the screen appears.
    - Fixed a not-yet-existing-bug that could have been caused by the width and height of Virus not correctly set. We don't draw them the size they are, they are scalled (by two factors). The resulting width and height however wasn't saved, which could have lead to bugs in the future.
    - Fixed a collision problem with viruses
